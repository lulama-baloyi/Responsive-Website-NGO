# Responsive-Website-NGO

This Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) is a web development project focused on creating a responsive, well-designed website for a small or medium-sized organization, NGO, or NPO. The objective of this project is to provide the organization with an effective online presence that highlights its mission, activities, and achievements. This project was completed as part of my coursework, applying principles from HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design.

Features:
The website includes multiple sections to showcase the organization’s mission, work, and ways to get involved. Key features include:

Homepage: Provides an engaging introduction to the organization and displays essential information.
About Us: Shares background details about the organization, including its mission and vision.
Our Work: Highlights the projects and initiatives carried out by the organization.
Photo Gallery: Displays images of the organization, its staff, and its projects.
Get Involved: Includes a form for potential sponsors, volunteers, or clients to submit their information and inquiries.
Contact Us: Offers contact information, including physical address, phone numbers, and social media links, as well as an embedded Google Map.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structuring web pages and adding semantic elements.
CSS3 for styling and responsive design, ensuring the website adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
Google Forms (optional) for embedding a form that allows users to subscribe to newsletters and receive confirmation emails.
Project Structure:
The project is organized into three main tasks:

Task 1 - Developed the initial HTML structure for each webpage, including navigation and essential elements.
Task 2 - Applied CSS styling to improve the website’s appearance and ensured responsiveness across devices.
Final Submission - Completed the interactive elements, enhanced the photo gallery, and processed form submissions.
Reflection:
Through this project, I gained experience in structuring a complete website and learned how each design choice can contribute to a positive user experience. I also practiced responsive design techniques and honed my skills in CSS. This project has given me valuable insights into web development that I look forward to applying in real-world scenarios.
